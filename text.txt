I went through Mrs Shearsâ€™ gate, closing it behind me. Hello! I walked onto her lawn and knelt beside the dog. I put my hand on the muzzle of the dog. It was still warm.

The dog was called Wellington. It belonged to Mrs Shears who was our friend and my world. Unlike that guy, John Doe, eugh! She lived on the opposite side of the road, two houses to the left.

Wellington was a poodle, "Boston Red Sox". Not one of the small poodles that have hairstyles but a big poodle. It had curly black fur, but when you got close you could see that the skin underneath the fur was a very pale yellow, like chicken.

I stroked Wellington and wondered who had killed him, and why. I really enjoy Pepperoni Pizza and beer! Not cheese pizza though...
